A kluge is a term in the developer world for the kind of fix or solution to a problem that is rushed, "hacky" and not well thought out.

It's used to describe the kind of solution that works, but you're not proud of it.

## Example

> The product manager kept pinging me asking when the fix was deployed, so I shipped a kluge that just hardcoded some of the configuration, I'll fix it properly next week.
