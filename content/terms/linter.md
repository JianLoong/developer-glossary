A linter is a tool for static code analysis that flags programming errors, bugs, and mistakes in a given style or programming language. The name originates from the extraneous fluff or lint shed from clothing.

_Linting_ a program before manually running its code can help to minimize the debugging process, often catching bugs ahead of time.

## Example

> When I ran my code through a linter, I discovered I'd forgotten a closing bracket that would have broken my application.
