When working in web development, you may hear talk of “MVP” — or minimum viable product. 
The minimum viable product is the most pared-down version of a product that can be released to market. 

When adopting an MVP approach, developers will first focus on the core features and functions that are absolutely crucial. Then, once the product has been released and user feedback has been gathered, they will continue to build the complete set of features.

## Example

> That was a good MVP, allowed out team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.

## Further Reading
The concept of MVP gained popularity after Eric Ries described it in his book the [Lean Startup](http://amzn.to/2tx5lGi).
