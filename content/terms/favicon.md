A favicon is a small 16x16 pixels icon used on web browsers to represent a website or a web page. Short for 'favorite icon', favicons are most commonly displayed on tabs at the top
of a web browser, but they are also found on your browser's bookmark bar, history, and more.
## Example

> A web designer can create such an icon and upload it to a website (or web page) by several means, and graphical web browsers will then make use of it.
